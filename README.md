### Configuring Display Dimensions
The dimensions of the embedded youtube video display default to 640px by 360px. These dimensions can be set in the plugin configuration page, at `/admin/plugins/config?name=YouTubeImport`. Setting these values can fix display problems on some themes. Keep in mind that you should include units in your width and height entries (e.g. "640px" or "100%").
